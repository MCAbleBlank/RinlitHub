> And thus, the most ***divine*** project team in human ***history*** was born (~~trying hard not to laugh~~  
> Therefore, the *ClassWidgets* team spent *two and a half minutes* creating this *RinLit Hub* that is famous at the top of the world.   
> ~~Of course, Lu Xun never said the above words~~
